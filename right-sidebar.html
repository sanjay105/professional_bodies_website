											<p>As part of Engineers’ Day celebrations, a RoboCode Competition was conducted at department level on 28.09.2014 from 1:20 pm to2:00 pm in IT-Lab-II under IE(I) Professional Body Activities for B.E. 2/4 IT (A&B Sections) and B.E. 3/4IT (A&B Sections)Students.
Total number of 8 students participated. Students were supposed to develop virtual robots using Robocode editor with Java language. The Robots code which worked without any compilation errors were packaged and considered for competition. All the working robots were subjected to a single battle. Scores were based on parameters like hitting, escaping from hits, escaping from obstacles etc. The first three robots which got highest score were awarded first and second & third prizes.
